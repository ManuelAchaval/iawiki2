This project was originally part of a study group in ID for Ideas. That group disolved so I decided to keep doing the project by myself.
 
At the begining, we were developing this website using REACT. But I am doing everything using HTML CSS and Javascript.

OBJECTIVE:
The project objective was to be a site like wikipedia were you could find different articles about technology (mostly AI) and that anybody could write one specifing 
the author if needed. 

LEARNING:
So far this project is challenging me in discovering ways of creating modals, and how to link them to every post someone writes.

Final thoughts:
With this project, I feel challenged and motivated to resolve every issue that appears ahead. Its far from being over so there's going to be changes in the future.
